A sharedrive mounter.

Takes a list of sharedrives and creates rclone VFS mounts.

Rclone config files can be generated to copy paste to your rclone config if needed.

Develop branch has custom mount paths and a mergerfs service file generator, see [trapexit/mergerfs](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs) for installation if needed.
